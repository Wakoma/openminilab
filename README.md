# openminilab

Take me straight to the resources: https://github.com/Wakoma/openminilab/blob/main/resources.md

## Why this repo? 

Since we built the nimble (https://github.com/Wakoma/nimble) in 2021 there has been an explosion in interest in minilabs.  Some folks are entirely new to minilabs/homelabs/selfhosting, while others are downsizing from 19" labs due to electricity costs, space requirements, etc.

This repo is completely open source, and intended to bring together resources for anyone interested in or currently building a minilab. We also aim to promote/develop open minilab standards to ensure we can learn and build from eachother. 

Our team is working on enabling underconnected communities around the world (2.6 billion+ people) to design, build, and manage their own connectivity infrastructure. We hope this repo is also a contribution to this work. 

## What is a minilab? 

For the purposes of this resource, anything less than 19" racks.  However, in you will still find materials related to and hopefully useful for larger setups.
